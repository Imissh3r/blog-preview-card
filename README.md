# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

This is my solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). It was a fun and focused way to practice semantic HTML, responsive design, and accessibility.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom properties (CSS variables)
- [Figtree font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree)

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce best practices like:

```html
<!-- Using aria-label for accessibility -->
<a href="#" aria-label="Open HTML & CSS blog">HTML & CSS foundations</a>
```
```css
/* Clean hover effects */
#title-txt a:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
